## Introduction

 The project aims to forcust sales of six week, ahead of time for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals as a Machine Learning Engineer.
 this project used to predict by using fourstore datasets.

## Overview

- Learning Outcomes
  > Statistical Modelling

> Using core data science python libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

> ML algorithms Logistic regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost

> Model management (building ML catalog contains model feature labels and training model version)

> MLOps with DVC, CML, and MLFlow

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/Ad-Campaign-Performance/SmartAd_A-B_Testing_user_analysis.git
cd Pharmaceutical_Sales_Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data and features

- The BIO data for this project :Train , test and Store Data 

Data can be found [here at google drive](https://[[drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rbiLJuE6WQzqX1sxhXsd1VtwwDumKeGE]]

The data collected for this challenge has the following columns

- Promo2Since[Year/Week] - describes the year and calendar week when the store started participating in Promo2
- PromoInterval - describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started, naming the months the promotion is started anew.
